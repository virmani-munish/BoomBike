# Project Name
> A US bike-sharing provider is BoomBikes. BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. BoomBikes wants to predicting the demand for shared bikes.
To give a brief overview of A bike-sharing system, it is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## General Information

-The objective of this project is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management and potential partners to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

- We are trying to find the number of rentals issued from the company based on numerous independent values such as temperature, weather, humidity, holiday, etc.
- Multiple linear regression is performed on the dataset.
- BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. BoomBikes wants to predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- BoomBikes wants to predicting the demand for shared bikes.?
- The Boombikes bike rental dataset is being used and name of the file is day.csv?

## Conclusions
- The R-squared value of the datasets for test is 79.5% which suggests that our model broadly explains the variance quite accurately on the test set and thus we can conclude that it is a good model.

- Our developed model's mean squared error is almost 0 on both the training and testing datasets which suggests that the variance is accurately predicted on the test set. The p-values and VIF were used to select the significant variables. RFE was also conducted for automated selection of variables.

- The major steps included in the python notebook are data interpretation, data visualisation, data pre-processing, model training, feature selection, residual analysis, model evaluation on the test set.
